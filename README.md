# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Title

A website which showcases my portfolio

## User Story

AS A front-end web developer<br>
I WANT a portfolio page to showcase my skills<br>
SO THAT potential clients can see examples of my work which will help win me work<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Tasks Completed

* Created portfolio page
* Used grid and flexbox
* Used css variables to make it easier to alter the page
* Used hover over effects
* Used media queries to alter the layout for mobile / tablet devices with smaller screens
